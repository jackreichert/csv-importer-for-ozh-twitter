# csv-importer-for-ozh-twitter
Add-on plugin for Ozh' Tweet Archiver

I created this for two purposes:

1. Since the Twitter API limits to 3200 tweets, I wanted a way to import the CSV Twitter offers as an archive. https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data

2. I wanted my tweets to be of custom post type 'tweet'. I also wanted hashtags and mentions as a separate taxonomy.

### This is an Alpha in-the-works release

This a bit hacky. I did it quickly, and don't plan on releasing it officially in the plugin directory. I pushed it, unpolished, so you can take it and run with it. You'll see some bad practices. Please ignore them.

Please review the code before uploading it to your own site.
